Steps to Create Node Application (Web-Based):




Step 1: Import required modules
Load Node modules using the required directive. Load the http module and store the returned HTTP instance into a variable.

Syntax:

var http = require("http");




Step 2: Creating a server in Node
Create a server to listen to the clientâ€™s requests. Create a server instance using the createServer() method. Bind the server to port 8080 using the listen method associated with the server instance.

Syntax:

http.createServer().listen(8080);






Step 3: Read request and return response in Node:
Read the client request made using the browser or console and return the response. A function with request and response parameters is used to read client requests and return responses.

Syntax:

http.createServer(function (request, response) {...}).listen(8080);
First Node Application
After combining all these techniques, you can create a Node application. This code below creates a Hello World web-based application using Node.js.
